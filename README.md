## Snippets from the code
### Here I have used lateinit variables for student's name to make compiler sure that these values are not null and will be initialized before use. Also I have used data class to store login credentials of students. I have hard coded some students' details by creating objects and directly used comparison on the objects for login check as they are objects of data class the data of the objects will be compared by default.

### In the second page I have linked recycler view with custom adapter. In order to bind each data to a view I have created the inner class of viewholder. The inner class extends recycler view's viewholder class(implemented inheritence).

### I have created a Singleton class as we need only one instance of list of cartoons in the entire application. I have used data class to store name and url of each cartoon show.
